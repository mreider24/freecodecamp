# Free Code Camp Problems

I had started up at freecodecamp.com before, but didn't make it through the front end certificate.  It's been a while and I don't feel strong enough in my JS to just pick up where I left off before.

I probably won't go through too many of the basic html and css stuff, but I do want to hit the JS stuff again and will put them here as I do.  

Since I am also trying to learn Python this summer I may end up trying to do the algorithm type problems in both JS and Python just to get practice in both.  We'll see.
